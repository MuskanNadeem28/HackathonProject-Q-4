# Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid Robot

## Introduction to the Capstone Project

The capstone project integrates all concepts learned in the previous modules to design and implement an autonomous humanoid robot capable of performing complex tasks in dynamic environments. This project demonstrates the convergence of ROS 2, simulation environments, NVIDIA Isaac, and VLA systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this capstone, you will be able to:
- Synthesize knowledge from all previous modules
- Design an integrated humanoid robot architecture
- Implement perception-action loops for autonomous behavior
- Deploy and test the robot in simulation environments
- Evaluate the robot's performance on complex tasks
