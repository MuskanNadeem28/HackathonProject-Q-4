# Module 2: Simulation Environments (Gazebo & Unity)

## Introduction to Robotics Simulation

Simulation environments are crucial for developing, testing, and validating robotics applications before deployment on physical hardware. This module covers two major simulation platforms: Gazebo (for realistic physics simulation) and Unity (for advanced visualization and AR/VR applications).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments
- Create custom robot models and worlds in Gazebo
- Integrate Unity with robotics frameworks
- Implement physics-based simulations with realistic constraints
- Connect simulation environments to ROS 2 systems
