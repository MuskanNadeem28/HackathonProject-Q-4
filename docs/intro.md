# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**! This book covers the essential concepts, tools, and techniques needed to understand and develop advanced robotic systems.

## About This Book

This book is structured into four core modules plus a capstone project, designed to take you from foundational concepts to advanced implementations in humanoid robotics:

- **Module 1: ROS 2** - Learn the Robot Operating System 2, the backbone of modern robotics software
- **Module 2: Simulation Environments** - Master Gazebo and Unity for robotics simulation and testing
- **Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac** - Explore NVIDIA's platform for AI-powered robotics
- **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems** - Understand cutting-edge multimodal AI for robotics
- **Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid** - Integrate all concepts in a comprehensive humanoid robot project

## Learning Approach

This book emphasizes:
- **Technical accuracy** - All concepts are grounded in official documentation and current best practices
- **Practical implementation** - Hands-on examples with code you can run and modify
- **Student-friendly explanations** - Complex concepts broken down for grades 9-11 level understanding
- **Simulation-first approach** - Learn and test in safe, repeatable simulation environments

## Getting Started

Each module builds upon the previous one, but you can also explore topics independently. Use the navigation menu to explore the modules that interest you most, or start from the beginning for a comprehensive learning experience.

### Interactive Learning

This book includes an integrated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chat system that allows you to ask questions about any content in the book. Click on the "RAG Chat" link in the navigation bar to access this feature.

### Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python recommended)
- Understanding of fundamental mathematics (algebra, geometry)
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
