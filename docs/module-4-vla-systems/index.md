# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems

## Introduction to VLA Systems

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems represent the cutting edge of robotic intelligence, combining visual perception, natural language understanding, and physical action to create robots that can understand and execute complex human instructions in real-world environments.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the architecture of VLA systems
- Implement multimodal perception systems
- Create language-grounded robotic behaviors
- Train and deploy VLA models for robotics tasks
- Evaluate and benchmark VLA system performance
