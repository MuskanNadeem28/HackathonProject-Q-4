# Module 1: ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)

## Introduction to ROS 2

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is the next generation of the Robot Operating System, designed for production environments and real-world robotics applications. Unlike its predecessor, ROS 2 addresses critical issues like security, real-time performance, and multi-robot systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the architecture and core concepts of ROS 2
- Create and manage ROS 2 packages and nodes
- Implement communication patterns (topics, services, actions)
- Work with ROS 2 tools for debugging and visualization
- Deploy ROS 2 applications in simulation environments
